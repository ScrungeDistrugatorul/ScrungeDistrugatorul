## About me
I am Adrian and I am currently studying **Creative Media and Game Technologies** at **Saxion University of Applied Sciences**.

I have a passion for creating (_and playing_) games. I started being interested in games since very little. I started with only playing them but after I got into high school I started being interested in how are games actually created and brought back to life and so my adventure started.

I started by using the code block in Scratch. I would spend hours fiddling and messing with them in order to find out how they work, what they do and how to create something. I even had a game released from there a long time ago so. I continued by trying to find other engines to create games and I found Gamemaker. I really did not spend that much time on it but I was having fun with following some tutorials from the internet. I also started experimenting with HTML and made my first website.

After starting university I really started trying out different things. I started learning C#, C++, HTML and CSS, Processing, Unity. I am also trying to learn pixel art and basic 3d modeling. I do not have a lot of experience but my motivation and passion for creating games keeps growing and I am more than willing to throw myself into the deep and learn or improve my skills.
